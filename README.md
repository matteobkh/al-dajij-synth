## Basic tone generator with GUI
Starting point for cross-platform graphical audio apps. Uses [PortAudio](https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio) and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) using SDL2 and OpenGL3.
### Installing and building
_Current makefile only works for MacOS (10.6+)_. Clone repo and submodules with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/matteobkh/al-dajij-synth`. Then run `make install-portaudio` (or just `cd libs/portaudio && ./configure && make`) then just `make`. See requirements here: [Building PortAudio for Mac](https://files.portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs/compile_mac_coreaudio.html). You can find the MacOSX 10.6 SDK [here](https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs/tree/master) though PortAudio seems to compile fine without it. Make sure SDL2 and OpenGL3 are installed.
